Description: +++++++++++++
        Fault handler
        +++++++++++++
        
        Fault handler for SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS and SIGILL signals: display
        the Python traceback and restore the previous handler. Allocate an alternate
        stack for this handler, if sigaltstack() is available, to be able to allocate
        memory on the stack, even on stack overflow (not available on Windows).
        
        Import the module and call faulthandler.enable() to enable the fault handler.
        
        The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and so it can only use
        signal-safe functions (eg. it doesn't allocate memory on the heap). That's why
        the traceback is limited: it only supports ASCII encoding (use the
        backslashreplace error handler for non-ASCII characters) and limits each string
        to 100 characters, doesn't print the source code in the traceback (only the
        filename, the function name and the line number), is limited to 100 frames and
        100 threads.
        
        By default, the Python traceback is written to the standard error stream. Start
        your graphical applications in a terminal and run your server in foreground to
        see the traceback, or pass a file to faulthandler.enable().
        
        faulthandler is implemented in C using signal handlers to be able to dump a
        traceback on a crash or when Python is blocked (eg. deadlock).
