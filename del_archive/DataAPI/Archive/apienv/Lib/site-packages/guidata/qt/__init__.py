    # For now, we do not force the QString, QVariant, (...) API number because 
    # `guidata` and its visualization counterpart `guiqwt` are compatible 
    # with both API #1 and API #2. Moreover, `guiqwt` is currently based on 
    # PyQwt, so unless we switch to Python 3 (probably not until 2012-2013), 
    # there is absolutely no point forcing API to #2 because it wouldn't work 
    # with PySide anyway (because a PySideQwt library would be needed).
    # But note that `guidata` itself already works with PySide (a few things 
    # need to be done to officially support PySide, like the file dialogs 
    # compatibility issues).
    #
    # As a consequence, with Python 2.x, the default PyQt API will be API #1 
    # (i.e. with QString and QVariant objects), unless the API has been set 
    # before importing this module.
